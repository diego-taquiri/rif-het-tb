**Manuscript ID**: JMM-D-24-00608R1  
**Authors**: Vallejos-SÃ¡nchez K., Taquiri-DÃ­az D.A., et al.

## ðŸ“‚ File included
- `wgs-accesion-numbers.xlsx`: A list of accession numbers for whole genome sequencing (WGS) data analyzed in the study.

## ðŸ“š Study summary
This research investigates rifampicin heteroresistance and mixed *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (Mtb) infections in clinical isolates from Peru (1999â€“2020), using WGS and phenotypic drug susceptibility tests. The findings highlight the prevalence and complexity of rifampicin heteroresistance and underscore the importance of advanced diagnostic tools to detect and characterize mixed and heteroresistant TB infections.
